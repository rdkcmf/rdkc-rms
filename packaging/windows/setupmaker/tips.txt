For Windows distributions, there is a run script for running the server in a command prompt. This script simply runs the Media Server inline, using config\config.lua as the main server configuration.
    run_console_rms.bat

There are several other scripts that can be used to create and manipulate the server as a Windows Service. These scripts need to be run as an administrator. You can verify they have worked by opening the Windows Services tool and looking for the RDKCMediaServer service.
    services\rms\create.bat : Creates and starts the Windows service
    services\rms\remove.bat : Removes the Windows service
    services\rms\start.bat : Starts the service if not yet started
    services\rms\stop.bat : Stops the service if it is currently running
    services\srvany.exe : Installs programs as services (from Microsoft).

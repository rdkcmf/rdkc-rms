#########################################################################MSS PERFORMANCE TESTS

DESCRIPTION
Two types of MSS performance tests are provided:
1. CREATE+PULL TEST. This requires a server only.
This test performs createmssstream and pullstream multiple times while gathering
CPU and memory usage statistcis at the server.
2. PLAYBACK TEST. This requires a client and a server.
This test uses the client to perform multiple simulated playbacks of MSS files on the server.
Statistics are gathered at the server while the client ramps up/down the number of playbacks.
Data gathered includes bandwidth, CPU, and memory usage.

PREPARATION
This part is only required if no media files at the server have been prepared before.
Please refer to the preparation steps in prep-mss.txt.


USAGE FOR CREATE+PULL TEST (ONLY SERVER REQUIRED)
Assuming the PREPARATION part above has been done already:
1. Run mss-server.rb.
2. Press [4] (or [5]) to test 10 (or 50) simultaneous MSS creates+pulls.
=> The status of ramp up/down, capture, cleanup will be displayed
3. Wait for ramp down, capture, and cleanup to be completed.
4. Press [X] to exit.
5. Run makesheet.rb to convert the results to a spreadsheet to see the charts.


USAGE FOR PLAYBACK TEST (SERVER + CLIENT REQUIRED)
Assuming the PREPARATION part above has been done already:
--SERVER SIDE--
a1. Run mss-server.rb.
a2. Press [C] to start capturing statistics.
a3. Wait for at least 3 lines of statistics.
--CLIENT SIDE--
b1. Run mss-client.rb.
b2. Press [M] to start ramping MSS players.
b3. Wait for ramp up and ramp down to finish.
b4. Press [X] to exit.
--SERVER SIDE--
c1. Wait for the client to finish ramping down.
c2. Press [X] to exit.
c3. Run makesheet.rb to convert the results to a spreadsheet to see the charts.

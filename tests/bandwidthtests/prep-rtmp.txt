#########################################################################PREPARATION FOR RTMP PERFOMANCE TESTS
This part is only required if no test files have been prepared before.

A. PREPARATION AT BOTH SERVER & CLIENT
1. Install Ruby
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3
2. Check if the EWS is working properly:
   Browse http://<rms_ip>:8888/info.php
   => shows PHP status.
3. Check if the RMS is working properly:
   Browse http://<rms_ip>:8888/RMS_Web_UI/index.php
   Click Connect.
   => shows RMS status

B. RTMP PREPARATION
--CLIENT SIDE--
1. If the RMS is not running at the client, start it.
--SERVER SIDE--
2. If the RMS is not running at the server, start it.
3. Copy sita720p.mp4 from the source server, typically:
   wget http://52.6.53.123:8888/sita720p.mp4
4. Move sita720p.mp4 to /var/rdkcms/media.
5. Change ownership and permissions to allow MP4 playback, typically:
   cd /var/rdkcms/media
   sudo chown rmsd:rmsd sita720p.mp4
   sudo chmod a+r sita720p.mp4
6. Test the playability of the MP4 test file, typically:
   ffplay rtmp://<rms_ip>/live/sita720p.mp4
   Alternatively, VLC, JwPlayer or other Flash players can be used.
7. If the MP4 test file is not playable, review steps A-3 and C-5.

C. RTMP SETTINGS
These settings can be modified to change the behavior of the RTMP ramp test:
1. RAMP_STEPS = number of steps to ramp up/down
2. RAMP_PULL_COUNT = number of streams to pull per step
3. RAMP_STEP_DELAY = delay in seconds between steps
4. Other settings that may affect RTMP performance:
   Linux: ulimit -n

D. COMMON SETTINGS:
1. REMOTE_IP = partner IP address
2. IN_URI = source URI for pullstream
3. IN_STREAM_NAME = localstreamname for pullstream

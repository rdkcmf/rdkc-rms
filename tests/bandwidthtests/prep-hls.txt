#########################################################################PREPARATION FOR HLS PERFOMANCE TESTS
This part is only required if no test files have been prepared before.

A. PREPARATION AT BOTH SERVER & CLIENT
1. Install Ruby
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3
2. Check if the EWS is working properly:
   Browse http://<rms_ip>:8888/info.php
   => shows PHP status.
3. Check if the RMS is working properly:
   Browse http://<rms_ip>:8888/RMS_Web_UI/index.php
   Click Connect.
   => shows RMS status

B. HLS PREPARATION
--CLIENT SIDE--
1. The RMS is not required at the client side.
--SERVER SIDE--
2. If the RMS is not running at the server side, start it.
3. Run hls-server.rb.
4. Press [8] repeatedly until all config entries are removed.
5. Press [2] to pull 1 stream from an external source.
6. Press [3] to create an HLS stream.
7. Wait for around 1 minute.
8. Press [8] repeatedly until all config entries are removed.
9. Copy hls433.tgz from the source server, typically:
   wget http://52.6.53.123:8888/hls433.tgz
10. Extract hls433.tgz to /var/www (overwriting /var/www/hls/sita720p).
11. Delete hls433.tgz to free up storage space.
12. Change ownership and permissions to allow HLS playback, typically:
    cd /var/www
    sudo chown rmsd:rmsd hls -R
    cd hls
    sudo chmod g+w sita720p
13. Test the playability of the HLS test files, typically:
    ffplay http://<rms_ip>:8888/hls/sita720p/playlist.m3u8
    Alternatively, VLC, Android MxPlayer or PocketProbe, iOS Safari can be used.
14. If HLS test files are not playable, review steps A-2 and B-12.

C. HLS SETTINGS
These settings can be modified to change the behavior of the HLS ramp test:
1. HLS_RAMP_STEPS = number of steps to ramp up/down
2. HLS_RAMP_PLAYERS = number of simultaneous playbacks per step
3. HLS_RAMP_DELAY = delay in seconds between steps
4. HLS_BIT_RATE = bitrate of simulated playback in bits/second
5. Other settings that may affect HLS performance:
   Linux: ulimit -n
   EWS: maxConcConnSameIP
   EWS: threadPoolSize

D. COMMON SETTINGS:
1. REMOTE_IP = partner IP address
2. IN_URI = source URI for pullstream
3. IN_STREAM_NAME = localstreamname for pullstream and createhlsstream
